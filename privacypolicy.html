Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
<BR>

However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.

<BR>
(a) consent; or
<BR>

You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
<BR>
7.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
<BR>
7.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data [by written notice to us] OR [by [methods]][, in addition to the other methods specified in this Section 8].
