      <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 50px;">Refund and Returns Policy</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; margin:75px;">
        <BR>The following Terms & Conditions are accepted by you when placing an order from CravingCake

            <BR> <BR>Order confirmation over the phone and online cannot be guaranteed until payment has been received. Pro forma payment is highly advised for orders placed using an invoice, and we reserve the right to cancel any order that is not paid for by the delivery date. The issuance and receipt of your invoice are considered confirmation of your order, and in the event that your order is cancelled or delayed, invoices will still be due because we may have had to turn away other customers and begin preparations for your order.
                <BR> <BR>On the date specified in your order, deliveries are made personally or by Royal Mail. On the day of your order, please make sure someone will be at the delivery address to accept the cupcakes. If no one is there, we will try our best to leave the cupcakes in a safe place (with a neighbour, receptionist, caretaker, etc.), but we cannot keep the cupcakes for a subsequent delivery; they will be left at the address you have provided. Although all of our drivers are trained in proper cake handling techniques and will always impart this knowledge to any post room staff, we cannot accept responsibility for how your cupcakes are handled after the cakes have been signed for.
                    <BR>    <BR>Additionally, if collections are accessible. After the cakes have left the bakery, we are not responsible for any damage sustained in transit.
                        <BR>       <BR>We do not accept returns on any of our cakes or cupcakes because they are all baked to order. You will only be eligible for refunds, credit notes, or replacement orders of equal value if you receive the wrong item or the products turn out to be of subpar quality. If this is the case, or if you are unhappy in any other way with the state or calibre of your cakes when they arrive, you must get in touch with us right away. After this time, CravingCake will not be held responsible for any complaints.
                            <BR>          <BR>On our website, blog, Twitter, and Facebook pages, we reserve the right to post pictures of the orders we prepare. You must let us know at the time of ordering if you specifically want us to comply with your request that we not use pictures of your order or that we send you a picture of your order.
                                <BR>              <BR>Please get in touch with us as early as possible if you need to modify the date, specifics, or all of your order. Orders placed over the phone or online that are cancelled 10 days or more before the delivery or pickup date are eligible for a full refund of the order amount; orders cancelled between 5 and 9 days before the delivery or pickup date are eligible for a 50% refund; and orders cancelled within 48 hours of the order date are not eligible for a refund.
