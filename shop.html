    <p style="margin: 140px; font-size: large;">One of the most significant problems of establishing a new information system, such as the EPR, is staff resistance to change. To elaborate, the existing EPR at Airedale has taken over 5 years to implement. Yet, this was not due to technology, but rather to staff opposition to changing from a 'trusted' paper system to a new electronic system. Change is frequently connected with increased stress or worry, which causes resistance from the receiving staff. It often feels much worse than it is, especially if your role is not directly involved in the transformation process. According to a study on technology resistance to change (Tsai et al., 2020), "previous research has examined the relationship between technology anxiety and resistance to change and has shown that technology anxiety can lead to resistance to change due to uncertainty and unexpected technological errors." This comment directly supports the behaviour of NHS staff throughout the transition from a paper-based system to an EPR system. However, this comment also demonstrates that worry can be minimised and extinguished if the technology is demonstrated to perform well and uncertainties are addressed prior to the transition. Airedale is actively exploring the deployment of a new EPR system in the next years, therefore recommendations and lessons learnt from previous experiences and reports, such as the one cited, must be kept in mind.</p>
        
    <p style="margin: 140px; font-size: large;">Drones are a technology that has yet to take off but has the potential to increase the productivity of numerous commercial areas, particularly healthcare. Drones are a new technology that will most likely become normal operating procedure for many organisations in the near future. Drones in the hospital setting could be utilised to transport items to patients who require minor medical equipment and supplies to remote regions.    This will be especially important for Airedale because of the scale of rural sites it covers, some of which are exceedingly difficult to reach. The advantages of deploying drones include lower delivery costs because ambulances and third-party delivery services are no longer required, and reduced wait time for patients because critical medical supplies and equipment may be supplied. The general public's awareness of drones has risen in recent years, according to the article (Amukele, 2019), a "Google search of "drones in healthcare" in April 2016 resulted in 784000 hits, while an identical search three years later in April 2019 resulted in 28.6 million hits." These numbers indicate that people all across the world are starting to explore and learn about the usage of drones, particularly in the healthcare environment. The study also effectively highlights some of the important advantages and disadvantages of deploying drones in healthcare. Drones are a new type of technology that Airedale should aim to deploy in order to improve the quality and level of patient care as outlined in the digital business plan. To summarise, it is quite likely that drones will be utilised for a range of commercial tasks in many industries once they are adopted by firms, however especially in the healthcare environment when transporting medicines, security and education about drone use must be considered.</p>
